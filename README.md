## Project Proposal

### Overview

An app where users can find local pet sitters, similar to Rover.

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- Unsure

### Data

- User name, address, email, password, pets, schedule
- Pet names, type, quantity, diet, care instructions
- Sitter name, address, email, password, capabilities, schedule
- Pricing info or trade system
- Feedback from users

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Users and sitters can log in
- Users can search and book available pet sitters
- Users can pay pet sitters, pet sitters can collect payment

#### 2.0

- Users and sitters can customize search
- Users and sitters can post their details/preferences
- Users and sitters can leave reviews for each other

#### 3.0

- Users and sitters can leave reviews for each other
- Users and sitters can recommend others to join the app
- Users and sitters can do "trades" instead of payments

### Notes

The priority is to bring together users/sitters that live in the same building.
